# Caption Club

Daily caption challenges. Write funny captions, vote for favorites, and share your creations.

English, Spanish, and Russian interfaces, selected from browser language preferences or a saved manual choice. Light, dark, and system themes. Independent, lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no third-party browser dependencies, remote fonts, analytics, or CDN.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 24+. No install or build step.

```sh
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The root opens this application; unrelated app routes and APIs are disabled. Data persists in `data/minute.sqlite`.

```sh
npm test
npm run check
```

## Deploy

Set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the exact HTTPS origin, give the process a persistent `DATA_DIR`, and put an HTTPS reverse proxy in front. Example Dockerfile, Caddy config, environment file, and systemd unit are included. Each independent project needs its own port and data directory. `.env` is not loaded automatically: use exported variables or `node --env-file=.env server/index.mjs`. See [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) for backups, moderation, identity limitations, and storage details.

Daily scenes rotate through five original vectors. Visitors can submit three captions per browser per day, vote, see yesterday’s winner, export cards, and share permalinks. Expand the scene pool in `server/content.mjs`.
